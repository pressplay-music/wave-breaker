## What is Wave Breaker

Wave Breaker functions as a brickwall limiter, ensuring that the amplitudes of your audio signal never exceed the defined threshold level. It employs a sophisticated "look-ahead" mode to analyze the signal and apply a time-variable gain reduction function. Limiting an audio signal reduces its dynamic range, enabling you to increase the output gain without risking clipping and ultimately achieving higher overall loudness. Nevertheless, it's important to manage distortion artifacts effectively. Wave Breaker simplifies this process by offering a fine balance between high gain reduction values and minimal distortion:

- Advanced distortion handling: Wave Breaker implements oversampling techniques to filter out aliasing and intermodulation distortion. Additionally, it takes true-peaks into account, ensuring sufficient headroom for audio signals after digital-to-analog conversion.
- Intuitive user interface: The user-friendly UI facilitates the correct setup of limiter parameters. The large input signal display makes it easy to find the right threshold level, while visualizations of gain reduction and output signals allow you to inspect the limiting result in real-time.
